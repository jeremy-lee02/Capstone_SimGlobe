        <h1 className='text-white'> Welcome to SimGlobe!<br/>
             SimGlobe is an immersive simulation game designed to enhance understanding of Macroeconomics and Global Trade. Through the use of a smart combination of fiscal and monetary policies, you aim at increasing the welfare of your citizens. You will have eight turns time to show the world that you are the best leader! You will chose one country among 50 countries that you will be leading. Your aim is to increase your population’s income, job opportunities, while keeping living expenses affordable and government expenditure in line. This is measured by the countries GDP, the unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the government’s budget deficit. Your citizens will keep a sharp eye on these variables to assess how well you are doing your job, which you will know every round through the approval rating. Besides that you will also see how the other countries are doing. Ultimately, the country with highest approval rating in the last round is the top leader. The next window will allow you to chose a country. When the simulation starts, you will be given a brief background on your country with some useful information on your citizens. In the main menu you will be able to change the key, five parameters: interest rate that the central bank sets, the Value added Tax affecting consumption, the corporate tax affecting businesses, the government expenditure, and also the tariff rate to be imposed on imports. You also will be able to look at previous values of your economy to see what worked and what didn’t. But be careful, the economy is like a large truck that you try to steer: soft moves can move it into the right direction while very aggressive moves may cause it to roll over and not recover anymore. <br/>
            Good luck, <br/>
            Mr/Ms. President! ❤️</h1>
